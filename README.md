- 👋 Hi, I’m Drew, @aburke161
- 👀 I’m interested in code/computers in general, as well as aviation. Also fascinated by open source software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python, SQL, MDX. I've worked with a number of different languages and always open to learning new things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I'm new to collaborating on open source projects and I just really want to get involved in the space. I'd be very exited to work on something related to aviation/SIMs.
